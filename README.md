# Overview of Predicting COVID-19 Cases Using FB Prophet

## 1. Introduction
FB Prophet is a powerful open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, particularly well-suited for time series data with daily or seasonal trends. Its flexibility, interpretability, and ease of use make it a popular choice for predicting COVID-19 case numbers. Prophet is designed to handle irregular data, outliers, and missing values, which are common in COVID-19 datasets. The model also naturally incorporates daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality, making it effective in capturing patterns like case surges during specific periods.

## 2. Problem Formulation
Predicting COVID-19 cases is framed as a time series forecasting problem. The goal is to predict the number of future COVID-19 cases based on historical case data. The FB Prophet model is particularly effective in capturing trend and seasonality components and can integrate external regressors (additional factors) that may influence case numbers, such as mobility data or public health interventions.

## 3. Data Sources

- **Case Data**: COVID-19 case data, typically collected daily, from sources such as Johns Hopkins University, WHO, or national health authorities.
- **External Regressors (optional)**: Factors like government intervention policies (lockdowns, mask mandates), population mobility data (Google Mobility), or vaccination rates can be added as external variables to improve predictions.

## 4. FB Prophet Model for COVID-19 Case Prediction

FB Prophet breaks time series data into three components:

- **Trend**: The underlying pattern in the data (whether the cases are increasing or decreasing over time).
- **Seasonality**: Recurring patterns in the data. Prophet automatically detects weekly and yearly seasonality but can also incorporate additional custom seasonal patterns.
- **Holidays/Events**: Prophet allows for the inclusion of known events that may influence the time series, such as lockdown dates or national holidays where COVID-19 case reporting may be impacted.

### Key Features of Prophet:
- **Additive Seasonality**: Automatically handles seasonality (weekly, yearly, or custom cycles).
- **Automatic Changepoints**: Detects sudden changes in trends, like the appearance of new variants or the introduction of public health interventions.
- **Handling Missing Data and Outliers**: Prophet is robust to missing data points and can manage irregular data intervals without preprocessing.
- **External Regressors**: Factors like mobility or lockdown measures can be added to influence case predictions.

## 5. Implementing Prophet for COVID-19 Prediction

### Data Preparation:
- Collect daily COVID-19 case numbers and prepare them in a time series format. Prophet expects data in two columns: `ds` (date) and `y` (number of cases).
- (Optional) Gather external data like mobility trends, vaccination rates, or government policy indices, which can be included as additional regressors.

### Model Training:
- Fit the Prophet model to the historical case data. Prophet automatically detects trends and seasonality.
- If significant changes, such as lockdowns or vaccination campaigns, are known, they can be added as "holidays" or changepoints to help the model adjust for these effects.

### Adding Seasonality:
- By default, Prophet incorporates weekly seasonality (e.g., case surges on weekends) and yearly seasonality (which may be relevant over longer periods).
- Custom seasonality can be added if needed, for example, incorporating trends linked to monthly or specific recurring patterns.

### Adding Changepoints and Regressors:
- Changepoints can be used to mark sudden shifts in case trends, like new lockdowns or the spread of a new variant.
- External regressors, such as mobility data or vaccination rates, can be added to the model to improve prediction accuracy by capturing external effects on case trends.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model performance using backtesting (e.g., using past data to predict future cases and comparing predictions with actuals).
- Typical evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the model's prediction accuracy.
